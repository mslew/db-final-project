# Final Project Assignment

## Requirements

For your final project, you will create a website that uses PHP to access a MySQL database. Your project should include the following:

1. A SQL script that contains
    - a physical implementation for your database (database, tables, constraints, **indexes**)
    - statements that inserts sample data into your database
    - statements that create a user and grants appropriate access to the user.  This user will access the database in your PHP programs.

2. HTML and CSS documents and PHP scripts used to implement a well-designed and useful website that:
    - displays an overview of the relevant data, excluding data that isn’t relevant to a user, such as autonumber keys
    - allow users to add, update and delete data in safe manner (prevent SQL injection attacks)
    - includes any additional web pages that you feel would be useful, for example, a welcome page
